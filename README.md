# IterativePrisonersDilemma

The IterativePrisonersDilemma is a competition between prisoners.
The winner is the prisoner with the most points at the end of the game.
Each prisoner plays matches against each other prisoner (and against themselves).
Each match is played by two prisoners and consists of multiple rounds.
During a single round, each prisoner has to choose between cooperating and defecting.
Each prisoner uses a different strategy to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
The amount of points each prisoner earns depends on their own choice and the opponents choice:

- If both prisoners cooperate, they both receive 3 points.
- If both prisoners defect, they both receive 1 point.
- If one prisoner cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives 5 points and the cooperator receives 0 points.
